I am a Software Development student with a **strong focus on backend development** and **logical problem-solving**.
I enjoy working with application logic, data structures, and backend systems, prioritizing clarity, correctness, and maintainability. I feel most comfortable designing and implementing backend solutions where reasoning and structure are key.
